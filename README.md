# Dart: Handling Empty Lists with reduce()

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty list.  The `reduce()` method requires at least one element to perform its operation; otherwise, it throws a `RangeError`. This example shows how to correctly handle this scenario using error handling or a conditional check.

## Problem

The `reduce()` method, while efficient for accumulating values, doesn't handle empty lists gracefully, resulting in a runtime error. 

## Solution

The solution involves checking if the list is empty before applying the `reduce()` method.  If the list is empty, you can provide a default value or handle the case differently to avoid the error.
